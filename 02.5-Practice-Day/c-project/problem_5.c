Otherwise she will buy Something from New Market. She also told you that, if she could buy the Gucci bag and she has more than 20 thousand taka she will also buy a Gucci Belt.

// See the sample input and output for more clarification.

// 20000               Gucci Bag
// 6500                Levis Bag
